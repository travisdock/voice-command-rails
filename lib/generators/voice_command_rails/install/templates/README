  Voice Command Rails has been installed! 🎤

===============================================================================

Next steps to complete setup:

1. Set your GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable

   Add to .env or set in your environment:

     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

   Get your API key from: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

2. Configure the gem (optional)

   Review and customize the configuration in:

     config/initializers/voice_command_rails.rb

3. Add the voice command button to your layout

   Add this to app/views/layouts/application.html.erb:

     <%= render 'voice_command_rails/audio_button' if current_user&.voice_commands_enabled? %>

   Or for all users:

     <%= render 'voice_command_rails/audio_button' %>

4. Add the response container to your layout

   Add this where you want responses to appear:

     <div id="voice_command_response"></div>
     <div id="voice_command_status"></div>

5. Create your first voice tool

   Generate a tool with:

     rails generate voice_command_rails:tool CreateTask

   Then implement the tool in:

     app/voice_tools/create_task_tool.rb

6. Add the voice_commands_enabled? method to your User model (optional)

   This controls which users can use voice commands:

     class User < ApplicationRecord
       def voice_commands_enabled?
         # Your logic here, e.g.:
         premium? || beta_tester?
       end
     end

   Or generate a migration to add a boolean column:

     rails generate voice_command_rails:migration

7. Include the stylesheet (optional)

   The gem includes default styles. To use them, add to app/assets/stylesheets/application.css:

     *= require voice_command_rails/application

   Or use your own custom styles by targeting the data attributes and CSS classes.

8. Restart your Rails server
